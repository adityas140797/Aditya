What are the delivery charges? </h2>
</font>
Delivery charge varies with each Seller.
Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. The delivery charge may be waived off by some Sellers, if you shop with them for a minimum predefined value. 

For example, seller WS Retail, which generally charges Rs 40 for delivery, provides free delivery on orders valued at Rs 500 or more. Please check with individual Sellers to understand what the delivery charges are.
